Welcome to Tanda's repo. This repo is about applying Gaussian Process (GP) to stellar modelling. The webpage is underdeveloping. If you find anything looks odd, please raise an issue. 

This repo contents
- Example codes to GP a stellar model grid based on GPytorth, including training, validating, testing, and a script to map GP model systematic uncertianty (in 'script' folder).
- Some learned GP models for an estabilited stellar grid as mentioned in the paper named "Modelling stars with Gaussian Process Regression: Augmenting Stellar Model Grid". (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1USZE3wTjvVaS0VbCdhXFEOl9XsCJ2clw?usp=sharing)
- A GP-predicted dataset based on above learned GP models. The dataset, as mentioned in Section 6, contents 500,000 predicted stellar models. (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JwHMHjIHUJmC9Kt7VgK2FVDokC7dNSWK/view?usp=sharing) 

# Updates 20211207: 
- Uploading main scripts used in paper draft named "Modelling stars with Gaussian Process Regression: Augmenting Stellar Model Grid" (in the "script" folder).
- Updating Sharing links for all learned GP models and the GP-predicted model dataset.
